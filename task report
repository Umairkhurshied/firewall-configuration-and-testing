Windows Firewall Configuration and Testing

I configured and tested a firewall rule on Windows to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet). First, I opened the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security console and reviewed the existing inbound rules.

I then created a new rule to block TCP port 23 for all profiles. After enabling the Telnet Client, I attempted to connect to port 23 locally, which failed as expected.

Finally, I removed the block rule to restore the firewallâ€™s original configuration. This exercise demonstrated how Windows Firewall can be configured to allow or deny specific types of network traffic based on rules, enhancing system security
